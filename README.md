# State Data Policy Options

State Data Policy Option Guidelines

Every day, state governments make decisions that affect the lives of their residents. As state governments become increasingly digital, the amount of digital data in states’ possession has grown exponentially. States are seeking to leverage this data to make more informed decisions and to deliver services faster, cheaper, and more effectively.

As states mature in their collection, maintenance, and use of data, their approaches can be fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable. In 2018, the Pew Charitable Trusts [examined](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2018/02/dasa_how_states_use_data_report_v5.pdf) how states use data to inform decisions. The report identified a series of strategic actions states can implement to advance how they use data.

Missing from these actions is the designation of a state executive leader to coordinate and facilitate the use of data statewide. The organization Results for America published a [State Standard of Excellence](https://2019state.results4america.org/) that identifies “Data Leadership” as a critical component for states in advancing their use of data and evidence. According to Results for America, “A designated chief data officer can create a coherent set of policies, structures, and guidance for how state agencies should routinely use data to improve programs.”

Based on these reports and lessons learned from the nation’s state Chief Data Officers, the State Chief Data Officers Network recommends the following principles for states to utilize in advancing their use of data:

**LEAD** - Designate an executive level data leader as the Chief Data Officer;

**PLAN** - Create a strategy, governance structure, and inventory of data;

**BUILD** - Increase the capacity of stakeholders to effectively use data

**SHARE** - Establish clear and predictable processes for data sharing;

**ANALYZE** - Provide mechanisms and platforms to enable data integration and analysis;

**SUSTAIN** - Ensure ongoing support exists for data efforts.

Key to the long term sustainability of state data efforts is establishing laws that ensure efforts will survive beyond a specific administration. While many states have used executive orders and memoranda of understanding to implement various data initiatives, these efforts can be rescinded at any time. Further, ensuring that a commitment exists from state legislatures demonstrates a broader commitment to sustainability from top-level policy makers.

This tool includes a series of examples of legislative language that states can draw upon to aid in implementing the six principles. These examples track to the six principles above and are based on existing laws from various states and highlight critical elements of the legislation.

**Model Legislation for State Chief Data Officers and Data Integration Centers**

## **Lead - Designate an executive data leader as the Chief Data Officer**

Why Establish a Chief Data Officer in law?

Many executive positions in state government are established by law. These positions range from agency or department heads such as a Secretary of Transportation to other types of appointed or executive positions such as the head of the state law enforcement department. Establishing positions in law signifies that both the legislative and executive branches of state government believe the role to be critical to the operation of state government and ensures the roles continue into future administrations.

### Establishing a Chief Data Officer and its authority/responsibility

#### Example 1: Connecticut: [https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap\_050.htm\#sec\_4-67p](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_050.htm#sec_4-67p)

Connecticut’s law broadly establishes the Chief Data Officer role, authority and responsibility. It is intended to be relatively simple such that it could be included in a budget authorization bill, while enabling a CDO to advance the core functions of the position.

Sec. 4-67p. **Chief Data Officer. Duties**.

\(a\) The Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management shall designate an employee of the Office of Policy and Management to serve as Chief Data Officer. The Chief Data Officer shall be responsible for \(1\) directing\* executive branch agencies on the use and management of data to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of state programs and policies, \(2\) facilitating the sharing and use of executive branch agency data \(A\) between executive branch agencies, and \(B\) with the public, \(3\) coordinating data analytics and transparency master planning for executive branch agencies, and \(4\) creating the state data plan in accordance with subsection \(c\) of this section. The Chief Data Officer shall carry out the responsibilities set forth in subdivisions \(1\) to \(3\), inclusive, of this subsection in accordance with the state data plan created pursuant to subsection \(c\) of this section.

\*States may want to consider replacing the word “directing” with “advising.” During a November 2019 convening, most state CDOs indicated that “directing” was too strong a word and may result in a lack of willingness to cooperate from partner agencies.

#### Example 2: Oregon: [https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills\_laws/ors/ors276A.html](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors276A.html)

Oregon’s law provides more specificity to the role of the CDO position by articulating specific duties and responsibilities.

Chief Data Officer; duties; rules. \(1\) The State Chief Information Officer shall appoint a Chief Data Officer.

\(2\) The Chief Data Officer shall:

\(a\) Maintain a central web portal for the publication of publishable data under ORS 276A.362.

\(b\) Establish the open data standard as provided in ORS 276A.356.

\(c\) Prepare and publish the technical standards manual as provided in ORS 276A.359.

\(d\) Create an enterprise data inventory that accounts for all datasets used within agency information systems and that indicates whether each dataset may be made publicly available and if the dataset is currently available to the public. The enterprise data inventory is a public record.

 \(e\) Provide information protection and privacy guidance for state agencies.

 \(f\) Establish an enterprise data and information strategy.

\(g\) Identify ways to use and share existing data for business intelligence and predictive analytic opportunities.

\(h\) Identify strategies to combine internal and external data sources.

\(i\) Establish statewide data governance and policy area data governance and provide guidance for agencies about data governance efforts.

\(j\) Oversee the delivery of education and standards to state agencies regarding data quality, master data management and data life cycle management.

\(k\) Form an advisory group to assist the Chief Data Officer in carrying out the duties described in this section and in establishing an enterprise memorandum of understanding for interagency data sharing.

\(L\) Submit a biennial report to a committee or interim committee of the Legislative Assembly related to information management and technology on:

\(A\) The status of agency posting of publishable data; and

\(B\) The status of data sharing within and between agencies, enabling cross-agency analysis to provide information for public purposes, including but not limited to program design and budgeting decisions.

Both the Connecticut and Oregon models align well with the core CDO responsibilities. The Connecticut example broadly establishes the CDO responsibilities enabling flexibility for the role to evolve over time, yet maintaining a core focus on critical aspects of the role. A board model may be preferred where states want to ensure that the role is not limited and can adapt to shifting priorities without seeking to amend the legislations

The Oregon example remains aligned with the core CDO responsibilities but provides more itemized details on the CDO responsibilities. Itemizing these responsibilities in legislation may be preferential for states that want to ensure the role either does not become too broad or by states that prefer to ensure the authority remains limited.

## Plan - Build a strategy, governance structure, and inventory of data

### Establish a plan

#### Example 1: Connecticut [https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap\_050.htm\#sec\_4-67p](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_050.htm#sec_4-67p)

Not later than December 31, 2018, and every two years thereafter, the Chief Data Officer, in consultation with the agency data officers and executive branch agency heads, shall create a state data plan. The state data plan shall \(1\) establish management and data analysis standards across all executive branch agencies, \(2\) include specific, achievable goals within the two years following adoption of such plan, as well as longer term goals, \(3\) make recommendations to enhance standardization and integration of data systems and data management practices across all executive branch agencies, \(4\) provide a timeline for a review of any state or federal legal concerns or other obstacles to the internal sharing of data among agencies, including security and privacy concerns, and \(5\) set goals for improving the online repository established pursuant to subsection \(i\) of this section. Each state data plan shall provide for a procedure for each agency head to report to the Chief Data Officer regarding the agency's progress toward achieving the plan's goals. Such plan may make recommendations concerning data management for the legislative or judicial branch agencies, but such recommendations shall not be binding on such agencies.

\(f\) Information technology-related actions and initiatives of all executive branch agencies, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of hardware and software and the development of software, shall be consistent with the final state data plan.

While Oregon’s CDO is required to establish an “enterprise data and information strategy,” Connecticut is the only state required by law to have a formal [state data plan](https://portal.ct.gov/CTData/Content/Connecticut-State-Data-Plan). The plan was developed in a series of iterative phases, with each providing an opportunity for input from the public and government agencies. The plan consists of a series of strategic principles and practices to guide agencies in the use and management of data, along with public policy issues called “Focal Points” to establish priority areas for state agencies to focus data efforts.

### 

### Establishing a data governance structure

### No state currently has a legislated data governance structure however the Commonwealth of Virginia has established one by [executive order](https://www.administration.virginia.gov/cdo/data-governance/).

### 

### Inventory Data

### Example 2: Florida

[https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/2500/BillText/er/PDF](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/2500/BillText/er/PDF)

The Chief Data Officer, in consultation with state agencies shall develop an enterprise data inventory that describes the data created or collected by a state agency, including geospatial data used in a state agency’s geographic information system, and recommend options and associated costs for developing and maintaining an open data catalog that is machine-readable. For purposes of developing the inventory, the Chief Data Officer shall establish a process and a reporting format for state agencies to provide an inventory that describes all current datasets aggregated or stored by the state agency. The inventory shall include, but is not limited to: 1\) the title and description of the information contained within the dataset; 2\) a description of how the data is maintained, including standards or terminologies used to structure the data; 3\) any existing or planned application programming interface used to publish the data; 4\) a description of the data contained in any such existing interface; and 5\) a description of the data expected to be contained in any currently planned interface.

### 

### Example 2: Connecticut

[https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap\_050.htm\#sec\_4-67p](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_050.htm#sec_4-67p)

On or before December 31, 2018, and not less than annually thereafter, each executive branch agency shall conduct an inventory of any high value data that is collected or possessed by the agency. Such inventory shall be in a form prescribed by the Chief Data Officer. In conducting such inventory, data shall be presumed to be public data unless otherwise classified by federal or state law or regulation. On or before December 31, 2018, and not less than annually thereafter, each executive branch agency shall submit such inventory to the Chief Data Officer and the Connecticut Data Analysis Technology Advisory Board.

Both examples provide a relatively straightforward approach to establishing data inventories. Florida’s law includes some details regarding the minimum amount of information should be collected as part of the inventory while Connecticut’s provide fewer guidelines. Additionally, Connecticut’s law requires that the inventory be updated on an annual basis while Florida’s contains no such requirement. Connecticut’s law is also limited to inventorying “high-value data” which means certain datasets such as spreadsheets maintained by an individual for non-critical purposes may not be captured.

Both Florida and Connecticut used a similar [template](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/Final-CT-Data-Catalog-Agency-Input-V10.xlsx?la=en) to collect their data inventories and both were able to complete the process within a few months. The inventories collect high-level information about various state data assets that range from large systems like Medicaid eligibility and claims to geospatial datasets. Connecticut’s inventory is [publicly available](https://data.ct.gov/browse?q=catalog&sortBy=relevance&tags=high+value+data) and has been updated for 2019.

## Share - Establish clear and predictable processes for data sharing

Many states struggle to share data across departments, programs, and systems in a coordinated and consistent way. Most states utilize individual memoranda of agreements or data sharing agreements on a project specific basis that is both time and labor intensive and severely constrains a state’s ability to leverage integrated data for policy analysis. The following are generalized versions of legislative remedies utilized by states that have enhanced their ability to establish statewide integrated data systems.

#### Example 1: Indiana’s Management and Performance Hub:

[http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2019/ic/titles/004/\#4-3-26](http://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2019/ic/titles/004/#4-3-26)

MPH duties

 Sec. 10. The MPH shall do the following:

\(1\) Establish and maintain a program to collect, analyze, and exchange government information in carrying out the powers and duties of the OMB and the powers and duties of the executive state agency sharing the data. In carrying out this program, the MPH may, in accordance with IC 4-1-6, obtain government information from each executive state agency.

\(2\) In accordance with IC 4-1-6 and IC 5-14-3, establish and maintain a program to make government information available to executive state agencies, political subdivisions, educational institutions, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, and the general public, subject to the following:

\(A\) A request for data subject to IC 4-1-6-8.6 shall be made in conformance with that section.

\(B\) A program established and maintained under this chapter must include policies governing access to government information held by the MPH under this chapter. Government information may be made available only in accordance with applicable confidentiality and disclosure laws.

\(3\) Establish privacy and quality policies for government information that comply with all applicable Indiana and federal laws, rules, and policies.

\(4\) In accordance with standards developed by the office of technology established by IC 4-13.1-2-1, establish and maintain a program to ensure the security of government information under this chapter.

\(5\) Conduct operational and procedural audits of executive state agencies.

\(6\) Perform financial planning and design and implement efficiency projects for executive state agencies.

\(7\) Advise and assist each executive state agency to identify and implement continuous process improvement in state government.

\(8\) Carry out such other responsibilities as may be designated by the director of the OMB or the chief data officer to carry out the responsibilities of the OMB or the chief data officer.

Some agencies may be concerned that legally protected data is unintentionally disclosed under state public records requests. The following language can be used to ensure that only from which the data originates determines whether such data may be disclosed.

IC 4-3-26-12 Title to government information

 Sec. 12. \(a\) Title to any government information that is obtained by the MPH under section 11 of this chapter and that is unchanged by the MPH remains with the executive state agency sharing the government information, including an executive state agency's sole authority to license use of government information.

 \(b\) Title to government information that is obtained by the MPH under section 11 of this chapter and that the MPH has changed in a substantive manner is vested in the MPH.

 \(c\) Requests made in accordance with IC 5-14-3 for government information to which the MPH does not have title must be directed to the executive state agency sharing the government information. The MPH may not fulfill such a request.

The following section is a critical element to streamline the sharing of data to a centralized data integration organization. By establishing the MPH as an agent of the agency that administers programs that collect data, it authorizes the MPH organization to receive data from an agency thus eliminating the need for individual memoranda of agreement with each agency and for each program from which the data will be shared. It does not eliminate the need for individual data sharing agreements.

**IC 4-3-26-13 MPH agent of executive state agency**

 Sec. 13. The MPH is considered to be an agent of the executive state agency sharing government information and is an authorized receiver of government information under the statutory or administrative law that governs the government information. Interagency data sharing under this chapter does not constitute a disclosure or release under any statutory or administrative law that governs the government information.

Given that the above language does not eliminate the need for specific data sharing agreements, this language enables the MPH to establish a [consistent approach](https://soi.formstack.com/forms/mph_dsa) to creating necessary agreements.

**IC 4-3-26-14 Prescribed form for data sharing**

 Sec. 14. \(a\) The MPH shall prescribe a form to be used to memorialize the sharing of data under this chapter.

 \(b\) The form prescribed under subsection \(a\) must be:

\(1\) completed by the executive state agency or person described in section 15 of this chapter; and

\(2\) signed by the administrative head of the executive state agency or person.

 \(c\) A data sharing form completed and signed under subsection \(b\) constitutes the agreement required by any statutory or administrative law that governs the data. No additional documentation may be required to share data under this chapter.

#### Example 2: North Carolina:

#### [https://www.ncleg.gov/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter\_143b/gs\_143b-1385.html](https://www.ncleg.gov/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_143b/gs_143b-1385.html)

Since an integrated data system generally involves the sharing of sensitive and legally protected personal information, states may seek to craft more detailed legislation in order to address any specific privacy or security concerns. Additionally, the legislative process may require negotiations to narrow more broad language referred to above. The following example specifically lays out the responsibilities of individual agencies and establishes detailed duties and responsibilities of a data integration center. In addition, where the previous example broadly designates the Indiana Management and Performance Hub as an agent of any program or agency that may participate, this example includes language intended to authorize the North Carolina Government Data Analytics Center as an agent of specific programs.

The following sections from the North Carolina General Statutes are intended to authorize the entity to receive data from specific programs. Similar to the above language from Indiana, this eliminates the need for program specific memoranda of agreements, however this identifies the specific programs and laws governing each program from which the entity may receive data. The following represents many of the critical programs in all states; however, it is not an exhaustive list. States may want to add or remove sections based on their priorities.

**\(c\) Data Sharing. -**

\(1\) General duties of all State agencies. - Except as limited or prohibited by federal law, the head of each State agency, department, and institution shall do all of the following:

a. Grant the State CIO and the GDAC access to all information required to develop and support State business intelligence applications pursuant to this section. The State CIO and the GDAC shall take all necessary actions and precautions, including training, certifications, background checks, and governance policy and procedure, to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the data in accordance with State and federal law and as may be required by contract.

b. Provide complete information on the State agency's information technology, operational, and security requirements.

c. Provide information on all of the State agency's information technology activities relevant to the State business intelligence effort.

d. Forecast the State agency's projected future business intelligence information technology needs and capabilities.

e. Ensure that the State agency's future information technology initiatives coordinate efforts with the GDAC to include planning and development of data interfaces to incorporate data into the initiative and to ensure the ability to leverage analytics capabilities.

f. Provide technical and business resources to participate in the initiative by providing, upon request and in a timely and responsive manner, complete and accurate data, business rules and policies, and support.

g. Identify potential resources for deploying business intelligence in their respective State agencies and as part of the enterprise-level effort.

h. Immediately seek any waivers and enter into any written agreements that may be required by State or federal law to effectuate data sharing and to carry out the purposes of this section, as appropriate.

\(2\) Specific agency requirements. - The following agency-specific requirements are designed to illustrate but not limit the type and extent of data and information required to be released under subdivision \(1\) of this subsection:

a. The North Carolina Industrial Commission shall release to the GDAC, or otherwise provide electronic access to, all data requested by the GDAC relating to workers' compensation insurance coverage, claims, appeals, compliance, and enforcement under Chapter 97 of the General Statutes.

b. The North Carolina Rate Bureau \(Bureau\) shall release to the GDAC, or otherwise provide electronic access to, all data requested by the GDAC relating to workers' compensation insurance coverage, claims, business ratings, and premiums under Chapter 58 of the General Statutes. The Bureau shall be immune from civil liability for releasing information pursuant to this subsection, even if the information is erroneous, provided the Bureau acted in good faith and without malicious or willful intent to harm in releasing the information.

c. The Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security \(DES\), shall release to the GDAC, or otherwise provide access to, all data requested by the GDAC relating to unemployment insurance coverage, claims, and business reporting under Chapter 96 of the General Statutes.

d. The Department of Labor shall release to the GDAC, or otherwise provide access to, all data requested by the GDAC relating to safety inspections, wage and hour complaints, and enforcement activities under Chapter 95 of the General Statutes.

e. The Department of Revenue shall release to the GDAC, or otherwise provide access to, all data requested by the GDAC relating to the registration and address information of active businesses, business tax reporting, and aggregate federal tax Form 1099 data for comparison with information from DES, the Rate Bureau, and the Department of the Secretary of State for the evaluation of business reporting. Additionally, the Department of Revenue shall furnish to the GDAC, upon request, other tax information, provided that the information furnished does not impair or violate any information-sharing agreements between the Department and the United States Internal Revenue Service. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a determination of whether furnishing the information requested by the GDAC would impair or violate any information-sharing agreements between the Department of Revenue and the United States Internal Revenue Service shall be within the sole discretion of the State Chief Information Officer. The Department of Revenue and the Office of the State CIO shall work jointly to assure that the evaluation of tax information pursuant to this sub-subdivision is performed in accordance with applicable federal law.

f. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to this Part, shall share \(i\) claims data from NCTRACKS and the accompanying claims data warehouse and \(ii\) encounter data with the GDAC in order to leverage existing public-private partnerships and subject matter expertise that can assist in providing outcome-based analysis of services and programs as well as population health analytics of the Medicaid and LME/MCO patient population.

This section contains language similar to the Indiana example making the office an authorized agent of an agency; however, it refers to specific programs or laws rather than broadly across government.

**\(d\) Provisions on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information.**

\(1\) Status with respect to certain information. - The State CIO and the GDAC shall be deemed to be all of the following for the purposes of this section:

a. A criminal justice agency \(CJA\), as defined under Criminal Justice Information Services \(CJIS\) Security Policy. The State CJIS Systems Agency \(CSA\) shall ensure that CJLEADS receives access to federal criminal information deemed to be essential in managing CJLEADS to support criminal justice professionals.

b. With respect to health information covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \(HIPAA\), as amended, and to the extent allowed by federal law:

1. A business associate with access to protected health information acting on behalf of the State's covered entities in support of data integration, analysis, and business intelligence.

2. Authorized to access and view individually identifiable health information, provided that the access is essential to the enterprise fraud, waste, and improper payment detection program or required for future initiatives having specific definable need for such data.

c. Authorized to access all State and federal data, including revenue and labor information, deemed to be essential to the enterprise fraud, waste, and improper payment detection program or future initiatives having specific definable need for the data.

d. Authorized to develop agreements with the federal government to access data deemed to be essential to the enterprise fraud, waste, and improper payment detection program or future initiatives having specific definable need for such data.

\(2\) Release of information. - The following limitations apply to \(i\) the release of information compiled as part of the initiative, \(ii\) data from State agencies that is incorporated into the initiative, and \(iii\) data released as part of the implementation of the initiative:

a. Information compiled as part of the initiative. - Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 132 of the General Statutes, information compiled by the State CIO and the GDAC related to the initiative may be released as a public record only if the State CIO, in that officer's sole discretion, finds that the release of information is in the best interest of the general public and is not in violation of law or contract.

b. Data from State agencies. - Any data that is not classified as a public record under G.S. 132-1 shall not be deemed a public record when incorporated into the data resources comprising the initiative. To maintain confidentiality requirements attached to the information provided to the State CIO and the GDAC, each source agency providing data shall be the sole custodian of the data for the purpose of any request for inspection or copies of the data under Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.

c. Data released as part of implementation. - Information released to persons engaged in implementing the State's business intelligence strategy under this section that is used for purposes other than official State business is not a public record pursuant to Chapter 132 of the General Statutes.

d. Data from North Carolina Rate Bureau. - Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any data released by or obtained from the North Carolina Rate Bureau under this initiative relating to workers' compensation insurance claims, business ratings, or premiums are not public records, and public disclosure of such data, in whole or in part, by the GDAC or State CIO, or by any State agency, is prohibited.

## Analyze - Provide mechanisms and platforms to enable data integration and analysis

## Sustain

Chief Data Officers can’t do the work alone, and need adequate resources to fund the baseline staff and technology infrastructure to help advance the use of data. Providing a baseline budget for a core data team and infrastructure allows a Chief Data Officer to support partner agencies that may be resource constrained. North Carolina’s legislation allows them to achieve economies of scale by building off their baseline funding to identify cost saving opportunities, recover any direct savings, and allocate them to the Government Data Analytics Center for future use.

CDOs will need to plan ahead for budget cycles, understanding their needs to maintain baseline services, and ensuring that their technology stack is properly maintained, kept up to date, and able to adapt to shifting needs. Additionally, CDOs will need to demonstrate the value they add in quantifiable metrics. For instance, the Indiana Management and Performance Hub identifies in it’s [annual report](https://www.in.gov/mph/1162.htm) that for every dollar invested in the MPH, it generates four dollars in value.

### Funding

#### Example: North Carolina:

[https://www.ncleg.gov/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter\_143b/gs\_143b-1385.html](https://www.ncleg.gov/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_143b/gs_143b-1385.html)

Funding. - The Department of Information Technology, with the support of the Office of State Budget and Management, shall identify and make all efforts to secure any matching funds or other resources to assist in funding the GDAC. Savings resulting from the cancellation of projects, software, and licensing, as well as any other savings from the utilization of the GDAC, shall be returned to the General Fund and shall remain unexpended and unencumbered until appropriated by the General Assembly in a subsequent fiscal year. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion of the GDAC in subsequent fiscal years be funded with these savings and that the General Assembly appropriate funds for projects in accordance with the priorities identified by the State CIO.

\(f\) Reporting. - The State CIO shall:

\(1\) On or before March 1 of each year, submit and present a report on the activities described in this section to the Chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations and Senate Base Budget/Appropriations Committees, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology, and to the Fiscal Research Division of the General Assembly. The report shall include the following:

a. A description of project funding and expenditures, cost savings, cost avoidance, efficiency gains, process improvements, and major accomplishments. Cost savings and cost avoidance shall include immediate monetary impacts as well as ongoing projections.

b. A description of the contribution of funds or resources by those private entities which are participating in public-private partnerships under this section, including, but not limited to, knowledge transfer and education activities, software licensing, hardware and technical infrastructure resources, personnel resources, and such other resources as agreed upon by the State and the private entity.

\(2\) Report the following information upon its occurrence or as requested:

a. Any failure of a State agency to provide information requested pursuant to this section. The failure shall be reported to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology and to the Chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations and Senate Base Budget/Appropriations Committees.

b. Any additional information to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations and the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Information Technology that is requested by those entities.

States may desire to partner with academic institutions or other non-government organizations to supplement their research and analytics capabilities. States like California and Colorado have established policy labs in partnership with local universities. These partnerships allow them to supplement their capacity with data scientists and researchers to better evaluate the effectiveness of public policy. Connecticut has established a partnership with a non profit, the CT Data Collaborative, to enhance public access to data and to train state and non profit employees in data literacy. Support for such public-private partnerships through legislation signals that the executive and legislative branches value this type of collaboration and sharing of knowledge and resources.

**\(2\)Public-private partnerships.**

The GDAC may utilize public-private partnerships and existing data integration and analytics contracts and licenses as appropriate to continue the implementation of the initiative. Private entities that partner with the State shall make appropriate contributions of funds or resources, including, but not limited to, knowledge transfer and education activities, software licensing, hardware and technical infrastructure resources, personnel resources, and such other appropriate resources as agreed upon by the parties.
